This program is designed to visually show how a GC works. It works by creating a bunch of particles that move in a sinusoidal pattern that simulates the "column". It then travels at different speeds depending on the oven temp, ramp rate, retention factor, etc.

It then hits the detector and you will be able to see how seperation occurs on a GC. Although the concept could also be applied to LCMS or any sort of chromatagraphy in general.
